== Documentation Preface

In this document I assembled a lot of information I gathered during my work of the last three years. As Linux distribution I chose Arch Linux so that a lot of commands are specific to Arch but should easily be adaptable to other distributions.

=== Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Christian, Claudius and Daniel for useful tips and interesting discussions and insights.

== Filesystem

=== Managing disk space

To clean up your harddrive, use `ncdu`. It is faster than `filelight`.

=== To many files

If for example `rm` refuses to delete files, because `*` cannot be
expanded since the argument list would get too log, you can use `find`:

[source,bash]
----
find /path/to/dir -delete
----

If you donâ€™t want that `/path/to/dir` itself is also removed, use

[source,bash]
----
find /path/to/dir -type f -delete
----

=== Handling multi-partition disk images

==== kpartx

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/multipath-tools.git
----

==== Access DOS-drives inside images with mcopy (mtools)

You can assign a drive letter with an image file with `~/.mtoolsrc`

[source,bash]
----
drive c: file="<path-to-image>"
----

Copy `file` from current directory into the drive assigned with the
partition at `offset` inside `disk.img`:

[source,bash]
----
mcopy -i disk.img@@offset file ::/
----

You can get the offset with `fdisk -l disk.img` and multiply `Start`
with `512`.

[source,bash]
----
fdisk -l disk.img | grep 'img1' | awk '{print $3*512}'
----

==== Information about dos drive

[source,bash]
----
minfo -i disk.img@@offset
----

=== ZFS

Install from `https://github.com/zfsonlinux/`. Use master branch for `encryption` feature.

==== Creating a pool

Never use dev nodes to create the pool as dev nodes depend on the physical bus structure, which
can change if controllers or some other hardware change.

Always use something like `/dev/disk/by-id/<ata-MODEL_SERIAL-[part]>`.

==== Start a scrub

[source,bash]
----
zpool scrub <pool>
----

==== View status

[source,bash]
----
zpool status
----

==== Exporting and importing a pool

[source,bash]
----
zpool export
zpool import -a
----
